Following setup required to make sure project up and run:

  - MySQL
  - Type Script Complier
  - Postman
  - PhpMyAdmin [optional]
  - VS Code [optional]


### Project Start Guide
##### Step-1
- Go to PhpMyAdmin/Terminal and create database `AIFMetrics` .
- If you are using PhpMyAdmin import sql file inside it. 
- You will find two table `user` and `comments`.
- User table has a default admin user. 
- Comments table has a comment by admin user.
- If you are using mysql from terminal, use restore command to update database using `AIFMetrics.sql`
#### Step-2
- Install postman to your machine.
- Open postman and go to Import section and click.
- Choose file tab and upload json file i.e. `AIF_Assignment.postman_collection.json`
- You can find this file inside postman-collection folder.
- You will see one collection will be added to your postman which contains all apis.
#### Step-3
- Go to front-end folder and run following commands -
    ```sh
    $ npm install or  yarn install
    ```
- To run front-end app, you can  type following  command
    ```sh
    $ ng s or  ng serve
    ```

- Now, app is up and running. Open in vscode and explore further.
- ###### Note: `For bulk upload user functionality, you can get excel file inside front-end/src/assets/file. `

#### Step-4
-  Go to back-end folder and run following commands  -
   ```sh
    $ npm install or  yarn install
    ```
- Go to `back-end/src/config` and open `index.ts`
- Now, configure port and database as per your machine settings.
- Next, from root dir `(directory where package.json exists)` run following commands as per requirements
    ```sh
    $ npm run dev
    This command start server at port 3000 using typescript files
    ```
     ```sh
    $ npm run start
    This command start server at port 3000 using dist folder. Dist folder generates when we build typescript project to js based project using tsc complier
    ```
    ```sh
    $ npm run build
    This command build typescript to js based project 
    ```
- Once server up and running go to chrome/postman and hit url `http://localhost:3000/` 
- If you get response `{"successMsg":"A big Hi from AIF Matrix"}`. That means our server is now up and running.
    
##### Now, we have finished setup.We are good to go to use our app. We can explore API's using postman.
